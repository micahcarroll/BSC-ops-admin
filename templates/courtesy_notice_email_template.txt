Hi {first_name},

This is a friendly notice that you have reached 10 down workshift hours at your co-op. It is your responsibility to check in with your Workshift Manager to ensure that your hours are accurate and up to date on the workshift site. If you reach 15 down workshift hours, you will be issued a conditional contract and will lose your seniority point for the term. If you are already on a conditional contract for workshift with the BSC, then you will be issued a notice of pending membership termination. Please get in touch with your Workshift Manager to discuss opportunities for making up your down hours.

Best,
Operations Team
Berkeley Student Cooperative
