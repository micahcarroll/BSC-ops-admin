Hello {first_name},

Attached is the conditional contract that you are being offered by the BSC for being down 15 or more workshift hours at {house}. Please read it over carefully and return a signed copy of the contract to the Central Office no later than {date_7days}, at 5pm. You may return a physical copy to the Central Office mailbox, or return a signed digital copy to opsadmin@bsc.coop.

You are expected to immediately comply with the terms of this conditional contract. By one week from today, you should be down no more than 10 hours. Should you fail to return the contract by the deadline or if you do not make up enough hours by {date_7days}, you will be terminated from the BSC.

Also attached is a 15-Day Notice of Potential Membership Termination. Again, as long as you comply with the terms outlined in the attached contract, and meet all deadlines, the termination will not be necessary.

If you have any questions, please contact {OPS_SUPERVISOR}, the Operations Supervisor, at os@bsc.coop. If you would like to request an extension to make up your hours, please submit a request to the Administrative Committee (AdCom). Information on how to submit a request to AdCom is available in this AdCom Guide for Workshift document. You may also contact the BSC Administrative Member Advisor if you have questions or would like assistance by emailing adminma@bsc.coop. 

Best,
Operations Team
